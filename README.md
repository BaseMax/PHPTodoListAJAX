After that you can use describe command in interactive mysql shell environment. To open this environment first run your mysql and use terminal or cmd in windows:

```
mysql -h <your-domain> -u <your-username> -p
```

Now select your Database:

```
USE <db-name>;
```

And after that get your tables:

```
SHOW tables;
```

For any table in your Database run below command and you should get same result like me:

```
DESCRIBE <table-name>;
```
